            <strong>Community</strong><br>
            We are community-oriented. We do not only serve as a go-to and central platform for everything geospatial but also
            the people behind the technologies. We are building a high-powered community where relevant information and
            necessary resources can be shared across the geospatial people and organizations. We are bridging the wide gap
            between geospatial technology and the people.<br><br>

            <strong>Creativity is an activity</strong><br>
            We believe every new day is an opportunity to build new things, therefore there is need share ideas and create contents that people can learn from and
            our users and the tech community better.
